Commodity Correlation Program

In this program, we are going to see what type of correlations, if any, are between WTI Oil, Brent Oil, Corn, Cotton, and Wheat.

Currently, we are pulling data from AlphaVantageAPI and saving it all in a merged prices dataframe. We then melt the merged dataframe, 
and save both dataframes to CSV, which should be in the root directory.
